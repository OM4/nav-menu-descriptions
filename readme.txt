Make it easy for your visitors to navigate around your website by including descriptions for each nav menu item.

== Description ==

Make it easy for your visitors to navigate around your website, by including detailed descriptions for each nav menu item.

WordPress has a built-in description field for nav menu items, however the description isn't used anywhere by default.

This plugin adds the description information to your theme's nav menu output, so that they can be styled using CSS.

If you have any other suggestions for other information that could be included, please [add your suggestion via GitHub](https://github.com/OM4/nav-menu-descriptions/issues).
